# A Study on Risk-Adjusted Portfolio Performance Evaluation of Leading NSE-Listed Equities Across Banking, IT, and FMCG Sectors.

This research project aimed to evaluate the risk-adjusted performance of selected equities from the Banking, IT, and FMCG sectors listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The study assessed how well portfolios performed relative to the risk taken, especially in the context of economic and political events like national elections in India and the U.S., which often influence market behavior.

Using a descriptive research design, the analysis covered a 5-year period (January 2020 – January 2025), incorporating stocks from 12 top companies including HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, TCS, Infosys, HUL, and ITC. The performance was measured using three key risk-adjusted return metrics:

Sharpe Ratio (total risk),

Treynor Ratio (systematic risk), and

Jensen’s Alpha (abnormal return over CAPM expectations).

The study involved time series analysis, including tests for normality, stationarity, white noise, and autocorrelation, using tools such as MS Excel, XLSTAT and EViews.

The results provided insights into sectoral performance differences, volatility patterns, and the impact of market conditions on return efficiency. Findings were used to make portfolio strategy recommendations for investors aiming to maximize returns while managing risk during periods of high uncertainty.
