# A Study on Risk-Adjusted Portfolio Performance Evaluation of Leading NSE-Listed Equities Across Banking, IT, and FMCG Sectors.

I worked on an MBA main project titled “A Study on Risk-Adjusted Portfolio Performance Evaluation of Leading NSE-Listed Equities Across Banking, IT, and FMCG Sectors.”
The objective was to analyze sector-wise portfolio performance relative to risk and provide actionable investment strategies. I collected data from 12 major NSE-listed companies over 5 years (2020–2025) and applied time series tests like normality, stationarity, white noise, and autocorrelation using EViews, GRETL, and XLSTAT.
I calculated Sharpe Ratio, Treynor Ratio, and Jensen’s Alpha to evaluate risk-adjusted returns. The analysis showed sector-wise differences, particularly during volatile periods like elections, and helped propose strategies for balancing returns with manageable risk.
This project strengthened my analytical skills in finance, statistical modeling, and portfolio evaluation.
